P1
What is sampling rate?

The sampling rate is the number of samples taken per second from a
continuous signal to create a discrete signal. It is measured in samples
per second (Hz).

2] Calculate the constant k for a resonator frequency of 500 Hz at 
a sampling frequency of 8 kHz

k=2Ï€ fo/fs
fo is the resonant frequency (500 Hz).
fs is the sampling frequency (8000 Hz).
k represents the angle in radians for one sample step.

k= 2pi 500/8000
k= 2 pi x 0.0625
k= 0.3927 radians


P3
Test a square-wave signal with a fundamental frequency of 100 Hz and two
harmonics at the specified sampling frequency of 8 kHz

Fundamental Frequency: 100 Hz
Harmonics: First two harmonics (300 Hz, 500 Hz)
Sampling Frequency: 8 kHz
Signal Duration: Assume 0.1 seconds (for visualization).

x(t)=sin(2pifot)+1/3sin(2pi3fot)+1/5sin(2pi5fot)
f0=100
3f0=300
5fo=500


P5

Select Sensor: Use accelerometers or velocity sensors.
Place Sensor: Mount on key machine parts.
Condition Signal: Amplify and filter signals.
Acquire Data: Use DAQ to digitize signals.
Sample: Ensure sufficient sampling rate.
Store & Analyze: Save data and perform frequency analysis.
Monitor: Detect faults and ensure machine health.

N=lenth of window
n=sample index

Hamming window:
w(n)=0.54-0.46 cos(2pi n/N-1), 0<n<N-1

Hanning window:
w(n)=0.5(1-cos(2pi n/N-1))

Rectangular window:
w(n)=1
