%The Z-transform is used to design a discrete-time PID controller by converting the 
% continuous-time PID terms into discrete equivalents.
%The proportional term remains, the integral term becomes (1)and the
%derivative term is approximated as(2)where Ts is the sampling period.
% These terms are combined into a discrete-time transfer function, allowing the PID
% controller to compute precise control signals for the DC motor, ensuring accurate and stable operation of the robotic arm.
