%3)DFT is used in MP3 audio compression by converting the audio
% signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. 
% This allows for the removal of less perceptible frequencies, 
% based on human hearing sensitivity. After DFT, less important 
% frequency components are discarded or quantized with fewer bits, 
% significantly reducing file size. Techniques like Huffman coding 
% further compress the data, and the Inverse DFT reconstructs the 
% audio with minimal loss of quality. This process efficiently 
% compresses audio while maintaining sound fidelity.
%4)DFT is used to analyze vibration signals by converting them from the time
% domain to the frequency domain. It identifies dominant frequencies 
% associated with specific mechanical components, such as bearings or gears. 
% By examining the frequency spectrum, abnormal peaks or shifts can be
% detected, indicating potential faults like imbalance, misalignment, or wear.
% These dominant frequencies serve as indicators of mechanical issues, allowing
% for early detection and prediction of failures before they cause significant damage.
